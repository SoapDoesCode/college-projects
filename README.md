# What is this?
This repo is where I upload any scripts I have written throughout/for my college course. It is intended purely as example code and I am unlikely to modify anything in the future whether that being to fix bugs, or to update to a new library.

Any and all code is provided as is. I do not guarantee usability of any code for actual use cases nor will I ensure compatibility with different systems
